# SPI Bootloader

This example application shows how to use the Bootloader Library to bootload an application using SPI protocol.

**Bootloader Application**

-   This is a bootloader application which resides from starting location of the device flash memory

-   It uses SPI peripheral library in non-interrupt mode

-   Trigger Methods

    -   It uses the On board Switch as bootloader trigger pin to force enter the bootloader at reset of device

    -   It checks for bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** from the starting 16 Bytes of RAM to force enter bootloader at reset of device


**SDCARD Host Application**

-   This is a embedded SPI host application which sends the application image stored in the SD card to the target board over the SPI communication

-   The user application binary is copied into an SD card and inserted in the SD card connected on the host board

**Test Application**

-   This is a test application which resides from end of bootloader size in device flash memory

-   It will be loaded into flash memory by bootloader application

-   It blinks an LED and provides console output

-   It uses the On board Switch to trigger the bootloader from firmware **\(May not be supported on all devices\)**

    -   Once the switch is pressed it loads first 16 bytes of RAM with bootloader request pattern **\(0x5048434D\)** and resets the device
